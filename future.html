            <p class="text-monospace text-left">oh my god, where do i begin?? i want to do so much with you once we finish school and get our lives together. and although going through school and all that is stressful, im glad you're by my side and im by yours every step of the way. i know soon you'll be off to nursing school far away from me, but that's okay cause i will be right here where you left me and being here to support you every step of the way. me being proud of you is an understatement. i am way more than proud of all the work you have done to get to this point in your life. you never let school or work get the better of you, and i know sometimes it almost did, but you persevered and you did it. you are so hard working bubz, most definitely the hardest working person i know. and with everything on your shoulders, you're still keeping a smile on your face and getting them straight A's. i really did luck out when you decided to give me a chance at being yours. but after we graduate i can't wait to actually start our lives together. before we even settle down as adults im excited to travel the world with you and experience cultures we know little about and just having fun meeting new people along the way. hopefully we find a permanent group of people who are down for anything and become our life long friends. in the future we will still have our potholes that we have to drive over and there's gonna be a few dips on the way, but you are the one aj. you make the happiest guy in the whoooooooole world. im so exicted babe. so. freaking. excited. from buying a house, to getting married, starting a family... ALL THAT AND THEN SOME. our future is looking so bright hunni. it seems so close but we still got a couple more years of bs (school). but we're gonna be there someday, i promise.   </p>
