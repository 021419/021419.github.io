        <p id="p" class="text-monospace">the year was 2015. you just came back from Hawaii and i had no idea what was to come. i remember going to the movies and that's when we first listened to the song that is playing right now. i instantly fell in love with this song because of its calming vibe and great animation that came along with it. once we started dating, i would always play this song cause it would make me think about you. our first two years were rough, ill admit it, but im glad we got through it. we grew as a couple exponentially and the hardships we went through made us into the power couple we are today. looking back at what we've been thorugh, i wouldn't wanna have to go through with anyone else. i was a very immature fetus... i remember always hating about hearing your partying phase or anything you did before you even dated me. oh my god i was annoying, and im so happy you stuck it out with me. now look at us, going into our fourth year together and trying to do as much as we can before we get too old. but even then i cant wait to grow old with you. here are some pictures of only a portion of the moments we went spent together, and these are the pictures that make me smile every time i look at them. i love you aj, now make sure you go back and click on the other link!</p>
